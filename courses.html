            <p>Full form of MEAN : MANGO DB, EXPRESS JS,ANGULAR JS, NODE JS<br>MEAN Stack is one of the most popular Technology Stack. It is used to develop a Full Stack Web Application. Although it is a Stack of different technologies, all of these are based on JavaScript language.MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code.React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces.AngularJS is a Javascript open-source front-end structural framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs).Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). </p>

            <p>Full form of MERN : MANGO DB, EXPRESS JS,REACT JS, NODE JS<br>MERN Stack: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code.React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). </p>
